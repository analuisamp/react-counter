# React Counter

This is a basic React project that implements a counter with three main functions: add, subtract, and reset the counter value. The project is styled with basic CSS and uses React's `useState` to manage the counter's state.
- **ADD**: Increases the counter value.
- **SUB**: Decreases the counter value.
- **RESET**: Resets the counter value to 0.
